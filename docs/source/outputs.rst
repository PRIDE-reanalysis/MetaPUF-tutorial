**Outputs of MetaPUF**
======================

The outputs from the pipeline include the following files

-  ``Protein sequence database/(s)`` : after running the pipeline, one
   folder named ``assemblies`` will be generated, in which a subfolder
   named ``databases`` will be created, all the generated protein
   sequence database/(s) are there.

-  ``Report informing assemblies in each protein sequence db`` : these
   files can be found in the folder of ``assemblies``

-  ``search results from SearchGui``: a folder naming as ``searchgui``
   would be created, and the zipped preotin database searching results
   for each sample will be generated in this folder.

-  ``Peptide/Protein reports from PeptideShaker`` : a folder naming as
   ``peptideshaker`` would be created, for each sample, three files will
   be generated by PeptideShaker tool in this folder, one mzid file, one
   peptide report file and one protein report file.

-  ``Post-processing reports``: a folder naming as
   ``Processed_Peptide_Reports`` would be created, containing csv files
   for each sample.

-  ``GFF format report``: in the ``Processed_Peptide_Reports`` file, a
   subfolder named as ``results`` would be careted, in which all the
   post-processed identification and semi-quantification results were
   transformed into a GFF file suitable for integrating into the MGnify
   website using a custom script, which mapped the identified proteins
   to their corresponding assembly.
