**Welcome to MetaPUF**
======================

MetaPUF is a set of piplines to generate study specific protein sequence
database/(s) from metagenomics and/or metatranscriptomics data, used to
analyse mass-spectrometry based metaproteomics and visualise the
integrated information in the MGnify website. All the pipelines are
wrapped in Snakemake.

The workflow is defined in snakemake and is available at `MetaPUF <https://github.com/PRIDE-reanalysis/MetaPUF.git/>`__
